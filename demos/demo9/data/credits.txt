<font=text_6l>Content of data/credits.txt</>

The demo uses:
- https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Kanit
- https://fonts.google.com/icons
- https://game-icons.net/

This whole text is measured via spacelib:terse package. Here are some supported features. Hold CTRL to enabled debug drawing.

<font=text_6l>Line alignment</>

<left>Left-aligned text.
<center>Centered text.
<right>Right-aligned text.

<left>There is no way at the moment to display text aligned to different sides on the same line.

<font=text_6l>Tab and Font</>

We can align text with simple tabulation; we can change font, the line height will be the highest font and other words will be mid-aligned vertically (at the moment there is no way to specify different alignment):

<font=text_4m>Item<tab=200>Value<tab=400>Enabled?</>
Alpha<tab=200>1,000<tab=400>Yes
Beta<tab=200>2,000<tab=400>No
Gamma<tab=200><font=text_8l>3,000</><tab=400>Yes
Delta<tab=200><font=text_6l>4,000</><tab=400>N/A
Epsilon<tab=200>5,000<tab=400>N/A

<left>                      All leading spaces are trimmed.
<tab=200>                   Use tab=X to move cursor to X. This line uses "tab=200".

<font=text_6l>Color, Alpha, Brightness</>

<color=#f00>                We </,color=#0f0> can </,color=#00f> change </,color=#ff0> colors</>.
<alpha=.5,color=#f00>       We </,color=#0f0> can </,color=#00f> tweak </,color=#ff0> alpha</,alpha=1>.
<brightness=.5,color=#f00>  We </,color=#0f0> can </,color=#00f> tweak </,color=#ff0> brightness</,brightness=0>.

<font=text_6l>Icons</>

We can use icons inline, for example: <icon=contract> Contract Icon and <icon=settings> Settings Icon. Terse package doesn't draw anything, it only calculates rect for the icon, the drawing is done by user code after terse object is created. Default icon size is taken from the current font height and <font=text_6l><icon=mail> Mail Icon</> is automatically larger. We also can provide additional icon size multipliers, for example:
- <icon=mail:1.5> Mail Icon x1.5
- <icon=mail:0.5> Mail Icon x0.5
- <icon=mail:2:1> Mail Icon x2 by width only
- <color=accent,icon=mail> Mail Icon</> colored with the text

<font=text_6l>Line Gap</>

We can manipulate gap between lines:
<gap=-.4,alpha=.2,font=text_6l>This text has gap -0.4 and alpha 0.2</,alpha=1>
<gap=-.4>And this one too.

<font=text_6l>Unbreakable sequences</>

Following text in quotes always displayed on a same line, if it wraps, it goes to next line as a whole: <color=primary_l5><nobreak>"This text uses nobreak command"</nobreak,/color> and this text can break to the next line as before.

<font=text_6l>Groups</>

<group=one>We can select groups</>, e.g. ask to mark specific sequences of words for their rectangles for some further processing. For example to have some hover effect on a group of words in a text, or have click-able link or known where some part starts so we can scroll to it. <group=two>This paragraph has two such groups (use CTRL to see).</>
