# SpaceLib

A retained mode UI library.

- TODO rework into sdl3 (instead of raylib) -- seems like text wrapping is not in raylib
- TODO support set_clip_children -- by default it is disabled
- TODO support for Texture frame var and set_texture()
- TODO support set_texture_color() -- so its possible to have solid color rectangle

- [?] support draw layers
- [?] instead of frame.var, have .text and .texture, which are nil be default; so its possible to have texture+text using single frame
